The following are the APIs which can help one to change user password as a functionality embedded directly in his/her application be it web or mobile.

**************
Reset Password
**************

It may happen that the person forget his/her password to the point that accessing OPAY services becomes impossible. In fact the majority of services offered by OPAY require strong authentication.

In that case OPAY offers a user-friendly service to reset password through a functionality commonly known as forgot-password. This service is only available two the users with an-existing OPAY account.

************************
Password Reset Procedure
************************

The password recovery is done into two phases which are Forgot password and reset password.

***************
Forgot Password
***************

In this phase, the user sends a request to OPAY system notifying that he/she has lost the password and would like to set it. All the user has to do is to specify his/her email and if the email is found existing in the system, OPAY will forward send a passcode to him/her via his email. Thus as developer you should be able to tell to the user to look check their emails and discover the passcode. It is the passcode which will help them to then reset passwords.

The following are sample forgot-password request and response samples.
