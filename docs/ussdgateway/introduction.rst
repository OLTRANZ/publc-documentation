Getting Started with USSD Gateway API
#####################################

In order to help developers easily developer USSD applications, Oltranz has developer a **USSD Gateway** developers can create USSD applications against and develop them very easily.

Oltranz **USSD Gateway** thought and designed to be cheap both in terms of amount of time one has to invest in developing an **USSD** application and service (**USSD** management) cost.

As it will be shown in the lines below, the same object that the developer is receiving from the gateway as request object is the same object he/she has to return back to the gateway as response. As result **USSD** application can be expressed as only one function.

***********************************************
Oltranz USSD Gateway is technology agnostic
***********************************************
Oltranz **USSD Gateway** does not impose any programming language choice to the developers. Developers are free to developer USSD application using any language of their choice such as **java, php, ruby, nodejs, python, go** and any other. The only thing they are to keep in mind is the language which is able to handle json object and format them as response.
