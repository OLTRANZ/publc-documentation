Requirements to deploy USSD app to our Gateway
##############################################

The very important thing to begin using Oltranz USSD Gateway is the ability to have a publicly accessible place where to host their USSD applications. Once the developer has hosted his/her application over internet and let it be accessible publicly, the following are the steps to will need to accomplished to begin accessing USSD over phones.

*********************
Get a USSD short-code
*********************

Oltranz USSD Gateway allows two types of USSD short-codes which are primary short-codes and secondary short-codes.

Primary short-codes
===================
Primary short-codes are those obtained from the regulator; for the application for short-code from RURA please following the following link apply here.

Once the short-code is obtained, Oltranz will help you to get it mapped to the telecommunication companies so that you can access it through out USSD Gateway. The advantage will be that you will not need to develop versions to meet specifications of each telecommunication company, this will be taken case by Oltranz **USSD gateway**.

Please note that for the primary short-code the owner will be fully responsible of all expenses linked to the use of that short-code and people the yearly allocation fee which is about **1000$**.

Secondary short-codes
=====================

Secondary short-codes are those which can be derived from the primary short-code. For instance if the the primary short-code is ``726``, secondary short-codes can be ``726*100`` and ``726*101``.

Why one can choose to go for secondary short-code? It is true that the secondary short-code will be length, but it is the very one to get very easily as it will be given directly by Oltranz without waiting for 3 months to get the one from RURA. In addition to that, once the secondary short-code is allocated it will be available immediately for use.

Thus secondary short-codes will be ideal to developers who want to test their USSD applications very quickly or developers who want to run cost-effective **USSD** applications.
